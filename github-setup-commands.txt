# GitHub Setup Commands
# Run these commands after creating the GitHub repository

# 1. Add GitHub remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/sherluck007655/sunx-loyalty-program.git

# 2. Push main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# 3. Push develop branch to GitHub
git checkout develop
git push -u origin develop

# 4. Go back to main branch
git checkout main

# 5. Verify everything is set up
git remote -v

# 1. Set up Docker Hub secrets in GitHub
# 2. Configure automated builds
# 3. Test the deployment workflow
